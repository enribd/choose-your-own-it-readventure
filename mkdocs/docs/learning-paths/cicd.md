It's all about automation. Accelerating release rate while increasing quality has been one of the main goals in the software industry for decades, now thanks to CI/CD tools like Github, Gitlab, Jenkins, Flux or ArgoCD organizations such as Netflix, Amazon or Google have reach that goal providing new software updates in a matter of hours or even minutes. Nowadays continuous integration and delivery principles are considered essential for any engineer worth its name, so now that you are here try to pick a nice book to improve your skills.

Things like simplicity, great cli and web interfaces and a ever growing set of features make of GitHub a very nice tool to have in your belt. In this book the author focuses on Actions, the CI/CD framework of the platform. He starts explaining from the very basic concepts such as what are jobs or workflows, but you soon will be able to build your own automations. Also the security has its place in the book to let you know about risks and usual mistakes to help you avoid them. |

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [Software Architecture :construction:](/learning-paths/software-architecture): Building software is not only about writing code, to design great platforms you should learn to think about extensibility, efficiency, easy integration, resilience, flexibility, and much more.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [Microservices :construction:](/learning-paths/microservices): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.

- [Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) :new:](/learning-paths/sre): SRE is about making productive system to stay up, to make update cycles simpler and more frequent, to identify and resolve problems and, of course, automating things to make the life easier.
