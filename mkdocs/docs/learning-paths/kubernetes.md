After mastering building and running containers at small scale, orchestration is the next step in the road. Kubernetes is the most popular orchestrator, backed by the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/), a variety os small and big companies, and open source projects. Thanks to its capabilities and the ecosystem of open source projects built around it, Kubernetes, is a the industry facto standard for running microservice platforms at scale.

It also demonstrates the Kubernetes API extensibility through drivers for networking, storage and more. Other interesting topis are admission controllers, operators, service meshes and security. Definitely this is a book I really enjoyed, I recommend to read it at the same time with [Design Patterns for Cloud Native Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-for/9781492090700/), it will broaden your vision as a developer as well as your perspective as platform engineer.<br><br><br>[**#platform-engineering**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#admission-controller**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#spiffe**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#csi-driver**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#cni-driver**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;|

Its a very popular pattern, in this book you will find what you need to get started to develop your own operator and all the tooling around the process. This book is a little bit 'old', many things have changed in this topic since 2020, it needs a second edition to adapt its contents to more updated practices.<br><br><br>[**#controller**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#feedback-loop**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;|

The author starts from zero explaining the motivation to adopt a serverless paradigm, then presents Knative in a technical demonstration of all its basic and some of the more advanced features like traffic management and application delivery. There are not many books on the topic yet as Knative is still a relatively young project.<br><br><br>[**#cold-start**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#scale-to-zero**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#faas**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;|


The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [Microservices :construction:](/learning-paths/microservices): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [System Design :ballot_box_with_check:](/learning-paths/system-design): Acquire the skill needed to design and build systems, no matter if simple or complex. Learn how to identify the elements needed to create systems, to resolve scalability problems, detect possible points of failure, when to use an API, where to place a cache, when to use a NoSql database, and more.
