Different from typical inter-service communication patterns like REST APIs or gRPC, event driven architectures allow to increase flexibility, agility, and speed in development processes by decoupling services. Synchronous calls are replaced by publishing events into a broker, from which the interested clients can receive the information. But there are many challenges when building this kind of architecture: re-adjusting the way teams think about communications, ensuring the information integrity and quality produced by the sources, stablishing secure and painless ways for consumers to integrate with the data sources, and more. Luckily the industry has evolved and experience in EDA is being documented in book and articles to let anyone learn good practices and how to overcome the many challenges ahead!.

The author also offers his experience in the field exposing the different migration mechanisms and their trade-offs. Also you will read about tools needed in the process of creating a new architecture and hear about some of the specific technologies involved in the event streaming industry.<br><br><br>[**#event-sourcing**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#event-storming**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#lambda-architecture**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#kappa-architecture**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#json**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#avro**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#grpc**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#schema-registry**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;|

There are also crucials thing like ensuring the quality of the information served from the sources, the cataloging system of the information served, and stablishing an easy and secure way for interested clients to access those sources. All this and more is explained in detail in what could be seen as a complement of the [Building Event-Driven Microservices](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-event-driven-microservices/9781492057888/) book content.<br><br><br>[**#event-storming**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;|
