Distributed systems are not new but the way they are built nowadays is. Monolithic architectures need to evolve to leverage the cloud and the many advantages that microservices offer (scalability, fast releases, high-availability, resilience, and more). As usually happen in life, nothing is just benefits, and microservices architectures are not different, they bring many challenges with them like a more complicated management or debugging, economic costs and the necessary knowledge to build and run them. However, if this kind of architecture fit your needs or if you are interested in finding out what all the fuss about microservices is about don't hesitate and dive in!.

Far from advocating for the monolithic architectures exile, the book offers useful insights to help you identify use cases for monoliths, or when to turn to microservices. It will teach you what microservices really are, their evolutionary origin, principles, characteristics and all the new challenges they bring to the table. Finally, the author explains how organizations should evolve to adapt their internal structure and vision in order to efficiently deliver value using microservices architectures. |

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [System Design :ballot_box_with_check:](/learning-paths/system-design): Acquire the skill needed to design and build systems, no matter if simple or complex. Learn how to identify the elements needed to create systems, to resolve scalability problems, detect possible points of failure, when to use an API, where to place a cache, when to use a NoSql database, and more.
- [Kubernetes :ballot_box_with_check:](/learning-paths/kubernetes): Run containers at scale and unlock the power of building microservice platforms thanks to the Kubernetes orchestrator.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [Golang :ballot_box_with_check:](/learning-paths/golang): A modern general purpose programming language born to make easier developing things like APIs, command line applications, cloud native applications, and concurrency patterns.
