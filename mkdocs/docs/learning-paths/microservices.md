Distributed systems are not new but the way they are built nowadays is. Monolithic architectures need to evolve to leverage the cloud and the many advantages that microservices offer (scalability, fast releases, high-availability, resilience, and more). As usually happen in life, nothing is just benefits, and microservices architectures are not different, they bring many challenges with them like a more complicated management or debugging, economic costs and the necessary knowledge to build and run them. However, if this kind of architecture fit your needs or if you are interested in finding out what all the fuss about microservices is about don't hesitate and dive in!.

    | **:material-numeric-1:{.order-icon}** |![img](/assets/books/covers/building-microservices.jpeg)| [**Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems**](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781492034018/) <br> *Sam Newman* <br> *Published in 2022* <br> *616 pages* <br> :dog2:{ title="Intermediate" } :green_book:{ title="Read" } :star:{ title="Excellent" } :bookmark:{ title="Must-Read" } | One of the most important books in the field. Far from advocating for the monolithic architectures exile, the book offers useful insights to help you identify use cases for monoliths, or when to turn to microservices. It will teach you what microservices really are, their evolutionary origin, principles, characteristics and all the new challenges they bring to the table. Finally, the author explains how organizations should evolve to adapt their internal structure and vision in order to efficiently deliver value using microservices architectures.<br><br><br>[**#distributed-systems**](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/distributed-architecture)&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#architecture**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;|

For those considering taking the leap, Sam Newman, offers the vision of where to start, how to split the monolith beast and what to do along the way to avoid being crushed by the microservice chaos. Definitely a nice guide to avoid stumbling over well know problems and apply best practices and patterns from the start of a difficult journey.<br><br><br>[**#distributed-systems**](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/distributed-architecture)&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#architecture**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;|

Basically a "from zero to hero" approach that will make you an expert if you read it carefully. Despite the fact that the book has some years, the content is still valid today, would be nice to have an update though.<br><br><br>[**#distributed-systems**](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/distributed-architecture)&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#architecture**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;|

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [System Design :ballot_box_with_check:](/learning-paths/system-design): Acquire the skill needed to design and build systems, no matter if simple or complex. Learn how to identify the elements needed to create systems, to resolve scalability problems, detect possible points of failure, when to use an API, where to place a cache, when to use a NoSql database, and more.
- [Kubernetes :ballot_box_with_check:](/learning-paths/kubernetes): Run containers at scale and unlock the power of building microservice platforms thanks to the Kubernetes orchestrator.
- [Event Driven Architecture (EDA) :construction:](/learning-paths/event-driven-architecture): Asynchronous communication between services is possible using events. There is a lot to learn here, the main challenge is changing the way you think about communication patterns.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [Golang :ballot_box_with_check:](/learning-paths/golang): A modern general purpose programming language born to make easier developing things like APIs, command line applications, cloud native applications, and concurrency patterns.
