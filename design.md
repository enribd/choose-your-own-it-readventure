# Design

Book information:
  - cover
  - title
  - author
  - release date
  - pages
  - url to official info
  - learning paths associated (icons?)
  - level: beginner, intermediate, advanced (icons?)
  - my own description (where does it fit in the learning path and why)
  - tags?  (icons?)

## TODO

- Add icons:
  - Difficulty levels
    - :hatched_chick: = beginner
    - :tiger2: = intermediate
    - :dragon: = advanced
    - Learning paths
- At the end of each learning path give some ideas about how to practice the skills acquired.
