# IT Bookworm


I am a professional Cloud Engineer / DevOps person / Architect. Sometimes I develop things in my free time just to have fun learning how not to do things. My main interests are the cloud, microservice architectures, EDA, serverless, system design, Kubernetes, and Golang.

This repo is conceived as a journal of my personal journey and a learning path to guide others who, like me, find in reading the best way to acquire deep knowledge.

I will put together a list that categorizes all the books I've read as well as those that I intend to read, or those that I consider of some importance in the IT field. The list is subjective, it will reflect my personal interests or the way I've decided to explore topics (most likely in a chaotic way). If you think some books may fit better in other categories, or the category names are not accurate enough, or have suggestions about possible improvements just let me know and I will gladly consider your opinion. 

Of course, there will be books broadly considered a must-read that I have not listed, that's either because  they don't fit in my career or simply because I don't know of their existence.
