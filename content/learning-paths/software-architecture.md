To build effective services and applications a set of rules have to define what are the goals of the system, what it can or cannot do, and how things are structured to accomplish all that. Software needs to be designed and structured to achieve reasonable maintainability, aceptable performance and good extensibility. Explore beyond the code and discover how systems work, how they were designed to scale and adapt in this huge and ever changing world.

Adding to all that you will learn skills like risk assesment, decision making based on trade-offs, or how to manage and assemble teams.<br><br> |

Some of the advanced topics treated are: decompossition patterns, service granularity, data management or distributed transactions. When facing problems at scale that knowledge is not only useful but necessary to success in the process of designing systems or adapting existing ones to new requirements.<br><br> |

A new edition of this jewel is in order because the publication was some years ago, but don't be fooled, the content is still valid so go ahead and dive in.<br><br> |
| **1** | ![img](/assets/books/covers/clean-architecture.jpeg) | [**Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design**](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134494272/) <br> *Robert C. Martin* <br> *Published in 2017* <br> *432 pages* <br> :dog2: :orange_book: :arrows_counterclockwise: | One of the most famous architectures in software is the Clean Architecture, applicable to different programming paradigms and clearly defined with design principles. Learn how to wield it in your projects to provide them with the necessary properties to create extensible, flexible, manageable and scalable software.<br><br> |

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [Microservices :construction:](/content/learning-paths/microservices): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.
- [Event Driven Architecture (EDA) :construction:](/content/learning-paths/event-driven-architecture): Asynchronous communication between services is possible using events. There is a lot to learn here, the main challenge is changing the way you think about communication patterns.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [System Design :ballot_box_with_check:](/content/learning-paths/system-design): Acquire the skill needed to design and build systems, no matter if simple or complex. Learn how to identify the elements needed to create systems, to resolve scalability problems, detect possible points of failure, when to use an API, where to place a cache, when to use a NoSql database, and more.

- [Golang :ballot_box_with_check:](/content/learning-paths/golang): A modern general purpose programming language born to make easier developing things like APIs, command line applications, cloud native applications, and concurrency patterns.
