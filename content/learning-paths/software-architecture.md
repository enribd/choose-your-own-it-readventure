To build effective services and applications a set of rules have to define what are the goals of the system, what it can or cannot do, and how things are structured to accomplish all that. Software needs to be designed and structured to achieve reasonable maintainability, aceptable performance and good extensibility. Explore beyond the code and discover how systems work, how they were designed to scale and adapt in this huge and ever changing world.

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [Microservices :construction:](/content/learning-paths/microservices): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [System Design :ballot_box_with_check:](/content/learning-paths/system-design): Acquire the skill needed to design and build systems, no matter if simple or complex. Learn how to identify the elements needed to create systems, to resolve scalability problems, detect possible points of failure, when to use an API, where to place a cache, when to use a NoSql database, and more.

- [Golang :ballot_box_with_check:](/content/learning-paths/golang): A modern general purpose programming language born to make easier developing things like APIs, command line applications, cloud native applications, and concurrency patterns.
