You want to create systems that resolve complicated technical problems, to find optimal solutions, to learn how evolve your systems to the next level, to rack your brains designing wonderful architectures that withstand the overwhelming onslaught of hyped user hordes. Well, as AC/CD sing: It's a long way to the top if you wanna Rock' n' Roll. But do not yield, tough efforts often bring solid results, keep calm and read hard!

Work queues, batch processing, adapters, ambassadors, event-driven processing or deployment patterns are some of the topics covered along with hands on examples for illustration. <br><br>[**#reliability**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#scalability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability)&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#mantainability**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#resilience**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#extensibility**]()&nbsp;&nbsp; |

When designing systems it's necessary to think about how incresing load will affect aspects like performance and reliability, that's the reason why scalability is a big subject and one of the most important properties of a system since the cloud flourished and extended.<br><br>[**#performance**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#latency**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#response-time**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#horizontal-scaling**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#vertical-scaling**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#scale-out**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#scale-in**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#scale-up**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#scale-down**]()&nbsp;&nbsp; |

Each chapter is a different interview that illustrates a different use case where technical decisions are made, balancing trade-offs to come up with an acceptable solution. The variety of problems resolved is great and the content is expanded by a list of books and articles referenced at the end of each chapter.<br><br>[**#byte-byte-go**](https://blog.bytebytego.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp; |

The author is well versed in many topics, from networking and databases to software development and algorithms, and it shows along the pages. Learn to design location based services, stock exchanges, game leaderborads and more.

Some predominating patterns for communication, composition, data and api management or scalability are explained in these pages, it could be really useful to know them if you are developing or designing systems based on the cloud.<br><br>[**#grpc**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#websocket**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#rest-api**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#api**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#sagas**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#orchestration**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#choreography**]()&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#cloud-native**](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cloud-native/)&nbsp;&nbsp; |

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [Microservices :construction:](/content/learning-paths/microservices): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.
- [Event Driven Architecture (EDA) :construction:](/content/learning-paths/event-driven-architecture): Asynchronous communication between services is possible using events. There is a lot to learn here, the main challenge is changing the way you think about communication patterns.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [Software Architecture :construction:](/content/learning-paths/software-architecture): Building software is not only about writing code, to design great platforms you should learn to think about extensibility, efficiency, easy integration, resilience, flexibility, and much more.

- [Kubernetes :ballot_box_with_check:](/content/learning-paths/kubernetes): Run containers at scale and unlock the power of building microservice platforms thanks to the Kubernetes orchestrator.
