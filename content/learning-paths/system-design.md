You want to create systems that resolve complicated technical problems, to find optimal solutions, to learn how evolve your systems to the next level, to rack your brains designing wonderful architectures that withstand the overwhelming onslaught of hyped user hordes. Well, as AC/CD sing: It's a long way to the top if you wanna Rock' n' Roll. But do not yield, tough efforts often bring solid results, keep calm and read hard!

Far from advocating for the monolithic architectures exile, the book offers useful insights to help you identify use cases for monoliths, or when to turn to microservices. It will teach you what microservices really are, their evolutionary origin, principles, characteristics and all the new challenges they bring to the table. Finally, the author explains how organizations should evolve to adapt their internal structure and vision in order to efficiently deliver value using microservices architectures. |

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [Microservices :construction:](/content/learning-paths/microservices): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [Software Architecture :construction:](/content/learning-paths/software-architecture): Building software is not only about writing code, to design great platforms you should learn to think about extensibility, efficiency, easy integration, resilience, flexibility, and much more.

- [Kubernetes :ballot_box_with_check:](/content/learning-paths/kubernetes): Run containers at scale and unlock the power of building microservice platforms thanks to the Kubernetes orchestrator.
