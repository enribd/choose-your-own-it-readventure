Distributed systems are not new but the way they are built nowadays is. Monolithic architectures need to evolve to leverage the cloud and the many advantages that microservices offer (scalability, fast releases, high-availability, resilience, and more). As usually happen in life, nothing is just benefits, and microservices architectures are not different, they bring many challenges with them like a more complicated management or debugging, economic costs and the necessary knowledge to build and run them. However, if this kind of architecture fit your needs or if you are interested in finding out what all the fuss about microservices is about don't hesitate and dive in!.

Far from advocating for the monolithic architectures exile, the book offers useful insights to help you identify use cases for monoliths, or when to turn to microservices. It will teach you what microservices really are, their evolutionary origin, principles, characteristics and all the new challenges they bring to the table. Finally, the author explains how organizations should evolve to adapt their internal structure and vision in order to efficiently deliver value using microservices architectures.<br><br>[**#distributed-systems**](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/distributed-architecture)&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#architecture**]()&nbsp;&nbsp; |

For those considering taking the leap, Sam Newman, offers the vision of where to start, how to split the monolith beast and what to do along the way to avoid being crushed by the microservice chaos. Definitely a nice guide to avoid stumbling over well know problems and apply best practices and patterns from the start of a difficult journey.<br><br>[**#distributed-systems**](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/distributed-architecture)&nbsp;&nbsp;[**#architecture**]()&nbsp;&nbsp; |
