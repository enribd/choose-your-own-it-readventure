Different from typical inter-service communication patterns like REST APIs or gRPC, event driven architectures allow to increase flexibility, agility, and speed in development processes by decoupling services. Synchronous calls are replaced by publishing events into a broker, from which the interested clients can receive the information. But there are many challenges when building this kind of architecture: re-adjusting the way teams think about communications, ensuring the information integrity and quality produced by the sources, stablishing secure and painless ways for consumers to integrate with the data sources, and more. Luckily the industry has evolved and experience in EDA is being documented in book and articles to let anyone learn good practices and how to overcome the many challenges ahead!.

There are also crucials thing like ensuring the quality of the information served from the sources, the cataloging system of the information served, and stablishing an easy and secure way for interested clients to access those sources. All this and more is explained in detail in what could be seen as a complement of the [Building Event-Driven Microservices](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-event-driven-microservices/9781492057888/) book content. |

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [System Design :ballot_box_with_check:](/content/learning-paths/system-design): Acquire the skill needed to design and build systems, no matter if simple or complex. Learn how to identify the elements needed to create systems, to resolve scalability problems, detect possible points of failure, when to use an API, where to place a cache, when to use a NoSql database, and more.
- [Microservices :construction:](/content/learning-paths/microservices): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.


Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [Software Architecture :construction:](/content/learning-paths/software-architecture): Building software is not only about writing code, to design great platforms you should learn to think about extensibility, efficiency, easy integration, resilience, flexibility, and much more.
