The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [Microservices :construction:](/content/paths/microservices.md): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.
- [APIs :new:](/content/paths/apis.md): APIs are one way services use to talk to each other, there are a lot of aspects involved: communication protocols (REST, gRPC, WebSocket, GraphQL, etc), interface definition, version management, testing, security, rate limiting, api gateways, and more.
- :soon: Event Driven Architecture (EDA): Asynchronous communication between services is possible using events. There is a lot to learn here, the main challenge is changing the way you think about information distribution.
- :soon: Serverless: Also known as Function as a Service (FaaS). It's a cloud-native development model and a computing paradigm that allows you to define your applications as functions and events and run them without provisioning or managing servers.
