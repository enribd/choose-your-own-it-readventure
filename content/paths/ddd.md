Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [Golang :ballot_box_with_check:](/content/paths/golang.md): TODO

- [APIs :new:](/content/paths/apis.md): APIs are one way services use to talk to each other, there are a lot of aspects involved: communication protocols (REST, gRPC, WebSocket, GraphQL, etc), interface definition, version management, testing, security, rate limiting, api gateways, and more.
