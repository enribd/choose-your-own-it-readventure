# System Design Learning Path

You want to create systems that resolve complicated technical problems, to find optimal solutions, to learn how evolve your systems to the next level, to rack your brains designing wonderful architectures that withstand the overwhelming onslaught of hyped user hordes. Well, as AC/CD sing: It's a long way to the top if you wanna Rock' n' Roll. But do not yield, tough efforts often bring solid results, keep calm and read hard!

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

- [Microservices :construction:](/content/paths/microservices.md): Study the pinnacle of distributed systems architectures, learn its tenets, and foremost, when and how to implement it.
- [APIs :new:](/content/paths/apis.md): APIs are one way services use to talk to each other, there are a lot of aspects involved: communication protocols (REST, gRPC, WebSocket, GraphQL, etc), interface definition, version management, testing, security, rate limiting, patterns, api gateways, and more.
- :soon: Event Driven Architecture (EDA): Asynchronous communication between services is possible using events. There is a lot to learn here, the main challenge is changing the way you think about information distribution.
- :soon: Serverless: Also known as Function as a Service (FaaS). It's a cloud-native development model and a computing paradigm that allows you to define your applications as functions and events and run them without provisioning or managing servers.
