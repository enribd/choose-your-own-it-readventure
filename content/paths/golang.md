This path starts with some books to grasp the basics of the language but building applications to make you apply knowledge to near real case scenarios. After that you will have to choose the following learning path depending on your needs or interests.

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:



Want to change the subject? Here are some suggestions about other paths you can explore:

- [Cloud Native Applications :new:](/content/paths/cloud-native-apps.md): discover how to build applications destined to run in the cloud, Kubernetes or a serverless environment. You will learn how to make your applications scalable, resilient, observable and more.

- [APIs :new:](/content/paths/apis.md): APIs are one way services use to talk to each other, there are a lot of aspects involved: communication protocols (REST, gRPC, WebSocket, GraphQL, etc), interface definition, version management, testing, security, rate limiting, api gateways, and more.

- [Software Architecture :construction:](/content/paths/software-architecture.md): TODO
