    One of the most important books in the field. Far from advocating for the monolithic architectures exile, the book offers useful insights to help you identify use cases for monoliths, or when to turn to microservices. It will teach you what microservices really are, their evolutionary origin, principles, characteristics and all the new challenges they bring to the table. Finally, the author explains how organizations should evolve to adapt their internal structure and vision in order to efficiently deliver value using microservices architectures.

    Intended as a companion of [Building Microservices](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781492034018/), this book focus in the things to take in mind to adopt a microservice architecture parting form a monolith. For those considering taking the leap, Sam Newman, offers the vision of where to start, how to split the monolith beast and what to do along the way to avoid being crushed by the microservice chaos. Definitely a nice guide to avoid stumbling over well know problems and apply best practices and patterns from the start of a difficult journey.

    One of the bibles of the microservice architectures, it teaches design, service communication patterns, testing, state management, deployment patterns, and more. Basically a "from zero to hero" approach that will make you an expert if you read it carefully. Despite the fact that the book has some years, the content is still valid today, would be nice to have an update though.

Work queues, batch processing, adapters, ambassadors, event-driven processing or deployment patterns are some of the topics covered along with hands on examples for illustration.

    A fair amount of information about distributed systems and scalability is contained in this book: databases, event processing, caching, asynchronous messaging... When designing systems it's necessary to think about how incresing load will affect aspects like performance and reliability, that's the reason why scalability is a big subject and one of the most important properties of a system since the cloud flourished and extended.

Each chapter is a different interview that illustrates a different use case where technical decisions are made, balancing trade-offs to come up with an acceptable solution. The variety of problems resolved is great and the content is expanded by a list of books and articles referenced at the end of each chapter.

    Once you are familiarized with the foundations of the language, this book will help you to wire things up and learn how to use the tools Go offers to build a real application. You will follow the author while he builds a snippets mangament webapp, along the way you will use the Go to create a web with html templates, to process html requests, to store content in a database, manage user sessions, some security practices, and more. I found this one of the best books about Golang out there, don't let it pass and grab it!.

#     The process of building an Event-driven architecture is no easy feat, the first step to doing it well is communicate with the stakeholders of the different bussiness domains involved, hear their needs, and identify the different communication patterns, entities and events in an event storming session. There are also crucials thing like ensuring the quality of the information served from the sources, the cataloging system of the information served, and stablishing an easy and secure way for interested clients to access those sources. All this and more is explained in detail in what could be seen as a complement of the [Building Event-Driven Microservices](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-event-driven-microservices/9781492057888/) book content.

#     Knative is, along [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com), one of the most popular ways to build a serverless platform over Kubernetes. The author starts from zero explaining the motivation to adopt a serverless paradigm, then presents Knative in a technical demonstration of all its basic and some of the more advanced features like traffic management and application delivery. There are not many books on the topic yet as Knative is still a relatively young project.

#     Production Kubernetes will guide you from the view of an amateur to the vision of all you need to know and implement in order to build a professional and productive microservice platform. It also demonstrates the Kubernetes API extensibility through drivers for networking, storage and more. Other interesting topis are admission controllers, operators, service meshes and security. Definitely this is a book I really enjoyed, I recommend to read it at the same time with [Design Patterns for Cloud Native Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-for/9781492090700/), it will broaden your vision as a developer as well as your perspective as platform engineer.

#     Operators are another way of leveraging Kubernetes itself, they offer you the possibility to customize and automate your workloads management. Its a very popular pattern, in this book you will find what you need to get started to develop your own operator and all the tooling around the process. This book is a little bit 'old', many things have changed in this topic since 2020, it needs a second edition to adapt its contents to more updated practices.

#     Every running system is bound to suffer an outage sooner or later, once you are in the critical zone you need to asses the state your system is in as quick as you can to repair it and minimize the down time. The authors show deep knowledge about how to make a system obserbable by exposing metrics and traces, the way you need to store them, and of course how to exploit them to reflect the system state every moment. Aside of outages, observability is also useful to leverage insights of the services regarding the manner you may want to improve them or adapt to new coming necessities.

#     Team Topologies offers a modern vision about how teams should be created and managed to optimize a company's internal functioning as well as the output it produces. It uses ideas from other management books, like *Accelerate* (Nicole Forsgren), and takes them a step further to create a framework that will teach you form, combine and coordinate teams. The authors present four different kinds of teams, the role they play for a business domain and how they should communicate between them to achieve the organization goals as efficiently as possible. Also, you will discover things to avoid when managing teams, and what affect negatively to their performance.
