    One of the most important books in the field. Far from advocating for the monolithic architectures exile, the book offers useful insights to help you identify use cases for monoliths, or when to turn to microservices. It will teach you what microservices really are, their evolutionary origin, principles, characteristics and all the new challenges they bring to the table. Finally, the author explains how organizations should evolve to adapt their internal structure and vision in order to efficiently deliver value using microservices architectures.

    Knative is, along [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com), one of the most popular ways to build a serverless platform over Kubernetes. The author starts from zero explaining the motivation to adopt a serverless paradigm, then presents Knative in a technical demonstration of all its basic and some of the more advanced features like traffic management and application delivery. There are not many books on the topic yet as Knative is still a relatively young project.

    In this book you will discover what properties an application should have to be considered cloud native by reviewing and extending in detail the classic [12 factors](https://12factor.net/). It will show you some useful patterns used to achieve things like: scalability, resilience, observability, and more. Along the way the author drops some insightful best practice pills about essential things like logging, caching, configuration management, etc.

    Production Kubernetes will guide you from the view of an amateur to the vision of all you need to know and implement in order to build a professional and productive microservice platform. It also demonstrates the Kubernetes API extensibility through drivers for networking, storage and more. Other interesting topis are admission controllers, operators, service meshes and security. Definitely this is a book I really enjoyed, I recommend to read it at the same time with [Design Patterns for Cloud Native Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-for/9781492090700/), it will broaden your vision as a developer as well as your perspective as platform engineer.

    Operators are another way of leveraging Kubernetes itself, they offer you the possibility to customize and automate your workloads management. Its a very popular pattern, in this book you will find what you need to get started to develop your own operator and all the tooling around the process. This book is a little bit 'old', many things have changed in this topic since 2020, it needs a second edition to adapt its contents to more updated practices.

    Team Topologies offers a modern vision about how teams should be created and managed to optimize a company's internal functioning as well as the output it produces. It uses ideas from other management books, like *Accelerate* (Nicole Forsgren), and takes them a step further to create a framework that will teach you form, combine and coordinate teams. The authors present four different kinds of teams, the role they play for a business domain and how they should communicate between them to achieve the organization goals as efficiently as possible. Also, you will discover things to avoid when managing teams, and what affect negatively to their performance.
