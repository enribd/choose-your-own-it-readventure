# [![icon](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=go)](https://skillicons.dev) Golang Learning Path

This path starts with some books to grasp the basics of the language but building applications to make you apply knowledge to near real case scenarios. After that you will have to choose the following learning path depending on your needs or interests.

It will help you to understand the language mechanisms and how to use them together while developing a snippet management web application from the ground up using REST, templating, and static HTTP content. You also will learn how to structure the files that conform your applications. A great well written, concise and direct book.    |
| **2** | :dog2: :green_book: :top: | ![img](/assets/covers/lets-go-further.jpeg) | [**Let's Go Further!**](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/) <br> *Alex Edwards* <br> *Published in 2021* <br> *582 pages* | With this book you will learn to build a REST API with state management using a database, authentication and authorization security mechanisms, observability capabilities such as logging and metrics. It also offers some software delivery techniques to take your API all the way up to production.                                                                           |

The following paths are opened to you now, choose wisely:

  - [Cloud native applications](#cloud-native-applications): discover how to build applications destined to run in the cloud, Kubernetes or a serverless environment. You will learn how to make your applications scalable, resilient, observable and more.
  - [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](#domain-driven-design): discover how to build applications destined to run in the cloud, Kubernetes or a serverless environment. You will learn how to make your applications scalable, resilient, observable and more.
  
## Cloud Native Applications

From now the focus will learning all the necessary concepts and techniques to produce scalable, resilient and observable applications, that are apt to run in environments like the cloud, container orchestrators or serverless environments.

Titmus* <br> *Published in 2021* <br> *433 pages* | In this book you will discover what properties an application should have to be considered cloud native by reviewing and extending in detail the classic [12 factors](https://12factor.net/). It will show you some useful patterns used to achieve things like: scalability, resilience, observability, and more. Along the way the author drops some insightful best practice pills about essential things like logging, caching, configuration management, etc. |
