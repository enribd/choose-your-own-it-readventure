It uses ideas from other management books, like *Accelerate* (Nicole Forsgren), and takes them a step further to create a framework that will teach you form, combine and coordinate teams. The authors present four different kinds of teams, the role they play for a business domain and how they should communicate between them to achieve the organization goals as efficiently as possible. Also, you will discover things to avoid when managing teams, and what affect negatively to their performance. |
